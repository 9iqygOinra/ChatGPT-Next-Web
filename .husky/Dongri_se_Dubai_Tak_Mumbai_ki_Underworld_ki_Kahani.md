The book is based on extensive research and interviews with former and current gangsters, police officers, journalists and other sources. It reveals many unknown facts and stories about the underworld, such as how Dawood Ibrahim escaped from India, how he became involved in the 1993 Mumbai blasts, how he established his empire in Dubai, how he collaborated with ISI and al-Qaeda, how he tried to assassinate Chhota Rajan in Bangkok, how Abu Salem betrayed him and was extradited to India, and how the underworld has changed over the years.
 
The book is a gripping and thrilling account of the crime and violence that has shaped the city of Mumbai and its underworld. It is also a fascinating portrait of the men who ruled the streets of Mumbai with their charisma, cunning and courage. The book has been praised by critics and readers alike for its authenticity, accuracy and storytelling. It has also been adapted into a web series called Mumbai Saga by Zee5.
 
Dongri se Dubai Tak is a must-read for anyone who wants to know the truth about the Mumbai mafia and its impact on Indian society and politics. The book is available as an ebook for free download on various platforms such as BookGanga.com[^2^] and SoundCloud[^3^]. You can also buy a hard copy from online or offline stores.
  
One of the highlights of the book is the chapter on Mumbai Saga, a web series based on the book that was released on Amazon Prime Video in 2021. The series stars John Abraham as Amartya Rao, a fictionalized version of Dawood Ibrahim, and Emraan Hashmi as Vijay Savarkar, a cop who is determined to catch him. The series also features Kajal Aggarwal, Mahesh Manjrekar, Rohit Roy, Anjana Sukhani, Prateik Babbar, Samir Soni, Amole Gupte and Gulshan Grover in supporting roles. The series depicts the rise of Amartya Rao from a small-time gangster to a powerful don in Mumbai and his rivalry with Savarkar and other enemies. The series also showcases the changing face of Mumbai from the 1980s to the 1990s, when mills were shut down and malls and skyscrapers were built.
 
The series received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the performances of Abraham and Hashmi, the action sequences, the cinematography and the music. Others criticized the series for being clichÃ©d, predictable, violent and glamorizing crime. The series was also compared to other films and shows on the same theme, such as Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Shootout at Lokhandwala, Shootout at Wadala and Sacred Games. The series was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed its release and reduced its box office collections.
 
Despite the controversies and criticisms, Mumbai Saga remains one of the most popular and watched web series on Amazon Prime Video. It is also a testament to the popularity and relevance of Dongri se Dubai Tak, which has inspired many filmmakers and writers to explore the dark and fascinating world of the Mumbai underworld. The book is not only a thrilling read but also a valuable source of information and insight into the history and sociology of crime in India.
